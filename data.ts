    description: `Get classic Strat sound with modern updates in a special finish.\n
    Over the decades, players have been continually inspired by the sound of a Strat. From the clarity of the high end, through the gut punch of the mids and the solid lows, it's a sound that's helped define what an electric guitar should be—versatile enough for any style and broad enough for any player to find an individual voice.\n\n
    This limited-edition Player Series Stratocaster comes in a special black finish with black pickguard and puts all of the classic features of the Strat at your fingertips while adding a modern edge, including a modern neck profile, medium-jumbo frets and a freshly redesigned 2-point fulcrum vibrato bridge.`,

    The Fender Meteora started life as what would have been a limited-run entry in their Alternate Reality series. When it sold out almost immediately, Fender looked at the fresh-from-scratch, space-age body design and realized that this was a guitar that was more than just a temporary fantasia. Armed with that original design and bursting with fresh ideas, Fender created the Player Plus Meteora. Loaded with a newly designed humbucker, the Fireball, and sharing a range of the playability features for which the Player Plus series has become known, the Player Plus Meteora looks like a future that we've all been waiting for. `,

    The Epiphone Joe Bonamassa 1962 ES-335 semi-hollow electric guitar is a tribute to a legendary guitarist and one of his cherished instruments. In 1996, Bonamassa purchased a red 1962 Gibson ES-335 and used it on his first solo album, A New Day Yesterday. In 2001, he sold the guitar to help fund his move to L.A, but as the 20th anniversary of Bonamassa's first record approached, a strange twist of fate and an unexpected phone call resulted in him being reunited with his old friend—that same red ES-335 that propelled him through his first solo effort and launched him into a new life on the West Coast.`,
